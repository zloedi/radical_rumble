Talking Points

Net -- net chan, zclient, zserver
Game -- Pawn/PawnDef, Board, Player, Filters, Utils
RRServer/Game_sv -- game simulation, pawn states
RRClient/Play/Edit -- WrapBox, QGL, Qonsole, SDLPorts
RR Server AND Client -- basically sending clocks around:
    movement + clock,
    attack clock,
    mana full clock
Standalone Server
