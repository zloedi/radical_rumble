Talking Points

Net -- net chan, zclient, zserver, deltas
    common scenarios:
        killed client, reconnect from client
        killed server, rconnect clients from server
Game -- Pawn/PawnDef, Board, Player, Filters, Utils, serialization driven
RRServer/Game_sv -- game simulation, pawn states,
RRClient/Play/Edit -- WrapBox, QGL, Qonsole, SDLPorts
RR Server AND Client -- deltas, basically sending clocks around:
    movement + clock,
    attack clock,
    mana full clock
Standalone Server
