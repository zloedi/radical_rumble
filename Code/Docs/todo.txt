It is a separate git repo (not submodule) and is .gitignored

notes on event 5

// thinking in terms of single entities vs sets
DrawHealthBar( size, position, ... )

// actually, this is an example of a filter
    vs Draw All Healthbars on filtered entities

// boiler plate code executes once

=== TODO ===

] <==== Use the loading bar for mana with a nice anim for the number
] (UI) Use the lightning icon from PlayType3 panel in the GUI pack for mana

] (UI) Unit icons with drag and drop
    * make the 3d client vertical for phones.
        * fix the camera position/angle/fov
            + automatic bounds and initial camera position
        * implement panning 
    ] spawn zones
] (INP) no input in the Unity client yet.
    ] (INP/UI) should demonstrate some serious shit with dragging though
] (PTH) units get stuck if endup on impassable hex after avoidance
    pathing should just add the nearest hex to the path
] (GYM) Replace the server tick with the gym version.
] (GYM) Dead are pawns with maxhp > 0 and hp == 0

] (DOC) put the discord server in the event 5 doc

] (UI) Timer?
] (UI) interesting mana bar
] (UI) make a nice win animation, see the one with the GUI pack
] (UI) show off at least two states (lobby+play)

] (BUG) Fast clicking leads to no-spawn
] (IMP) Binary (compressed) deltas.
] (IMP) Turn the cached pather lists into arrays on cache.
] (IMP) DNS support

] (IMP) Implement button 'ready'/'not ready'

] (IMP) Improve the editor.
] (IMP) Player (not client) reconnect.

] (INPUT) make the spawns to work in 3d too

] (SV) projectiles should travel with constant speed, not constant time

== Thoughts and prayers ==

Finer state machine
a pawn is either idling, moving (has a valid attack target, lerping along its segment), or attacking.

types of movement:
    pathing
    charge enemy (has directly 'visible' enemy in aggro range)
    avoid teammates

SOA:
    easy copy
    easy delta
    pass around and manipulate only fields with no dependencies
        i.e. overlapping solver can get positions, no need to introduce deps or copy
