] Pawn avoidance

== Implement a routine to get a proper attack position for given attacker and defender. ==
    ] Optimization: Fill potential-colliders list by enumerating tiles in max-pawn-radius range.
        * Store the max-pawn-radius in a nice global, derive it in Pawn.Defs and stuff.
        ] The potential-collider-pawns and potential-collider-hexes lists are Game.List<> members.
        ] Make a potential-collider-hexes pattern before hand.
        ] Use that to generate a list of hexes by offsetting it from defender origin hex.
        ] Use the hexes list to gather the pawns from the game.gridPawn filter into the pawns list
        
    * Check the solver in gallium/10min-phisics. Later use that, to pick a nice spot for attack.
        * Distribute the editor test pawns on spawn.
        * Implemented SolveOverlapping routine.

    Testing the proper-attack-position routine inside the Map Editor.
        * Use lists for def and origin
        * Implement command place fake pawns of team
        * Implement command remove fake pawns of team
        * Bind these commands to keys
        * Draw the pawns with colors by team
        * Show the keybinds on screen using WBUI
        -> Imagine the moving attacker is at the mouse cursor and solve when the mouse moves.

    Integrate the ground units proper-attack-position in the actual multiplayer.
        ] Implement filter 'groundUnits'
        ] Keep the attack slots (position to attack from) in the moving attacker pawns.
        ] Implement filter 'groundUnits/focusedOnMe' -- moving pawns focused on me.
        ] Implement filter 'groundUnits/avoidingMe' -- moving pawns on my team trying to avoid me
        ] focusedOnMe being sorted by distance is a good idea.
        ] ? Implement filter 'groundUnits/attackingMe' -- pawns currently attacking me

        ] Attack slot with position 0,0 is considered invalid and need to be picked again.
            To get an attack slot for a pawn:
                ] Get the defender -> moving attacker segment.
                ] Place the moving attacker slot at defender-radius distance along the segment.
                ] SolveOverlapping() for all slots on defender (inv mass 1) combined with all
                  active (non-moving/arrived) attackers (inv mass 0 -- inert).

        Once picked (valid != 0,0), the slots are kept until:
            defender moves.
            defender dies.
            moving attacker dies.
            moving attacker is interrupted / interested in another target.
        ] If any of these is false -- go through the defender's 'focusedOnMe' filter and erase
          the moving attackers attack slots, forcing them to be eventually redistributed.

== Implement teammates avoidance. ==

== Thoughts and prayers ==

Finer state machine
a pawn is either idling, moving (has a valid attack target, lerping along its segment), or attacking.

types of movement:
    pathing
    charge enemy (has directly 'visible' enemy in aggro range)
    avoid teammates

don't use PassableTerrainToTarget while checking opponent for visibility.
    use the pather
    if path is only 2 nodes, you can reach by straight line

SOA:
    easy copy
    easy delta
    pass around and manipulate only fields with no dependencies
        i.e. overlapping solver can get positions, no need to introduce deps or copy
